Fixed blank lines in world output when Tcl read a partial line of text.
Fixed /escape to properly escape lines including backslashes.
Fixed bleeding of text between worlds and duplication of text when a trigger
  encounters an error.

  are set, and the macro proxy_command is defined, then instead of connecting
  directly to a world, Trebuchet will connect to proxy_host:proxy_port, then
  run proxy_command as soon as a connection is established, passing the real
  host and port as arguments.  If a macro proxy_read is also defined, this
  command will be called with each new line of text read from the world until
  it sets proxy_connected to some true value, at which point the world is
  connected; it sets proxy_delay_connect, which causes the connection to be
  established on the first line read; or proxy_error, which causes the
  connection attempt to fail and the socket to be disconnected.  The
  proxy_command macro can also set proxy_delay_connect for cases where the
  proxy does not need any lines read.

  generated.

  process_command as a script.

  available to be read to being able to write data.
Changed command processing so macros and commands all have return values
  wherever possible.
Changed result displaying so results of commands are only displayed if the
  command was entered by the user.
Changed source_if_exists to catch errors.  FIXME: Errors are not displayed.
  Perhaps loading of .trc files should be processed by process_commands.
Changed tracking of sockets so /socket:foreground will be the visible world
  and /socket:current will be the active world.
Changed command history to not log blank or duplicate commands.
Changed handling of error conditions to only display an error dialog when it
  is absolutely necessary, for example in fileevent handling and hilite
  processing.  All other error displays will be handled by the error handler.

  executes COMMAND, with the list of read lines in the '$treb_readlines_text'
  global variable.
Fixed bug with /textdlog -nowrap that didn't set the wrapping correctly.
Changed the Edit Script dialog in /hilite GUI editor to make it larger and
  more usable for scripts.

Added a scrollbar to the script edit control in the /bind GUI editor.



TrebTk 1.0a30

  this should make it a bit more intuitive, but it still needs work.
Changed button layouts on all /editdlog and /newdlog dialogs.
Added initial /tool class to handle trusted tools.  Needs lots of work still.
Added many capabilities to the /textdlog command, to allow it to be used from
  scripts to return data, etc.  -modal, -variable, -buttons, -donecommand,
  and -persistent are the added options.  Use /textdlog -help for more info.

  This should improve remote Xwindows performance.
Changed /quit to only confirm exiting when worlds are still connected.
Changed /quit to ask if you want to save changes to prefs, macros, worlds, etc.
Added /dokey to handle most standard keypress commands used by trebuchet.
Fixed an ugly bug with deleting hilites.
Fixed a bug with word hilites not hiliting text of a different case from the pattern.




TrebTk 1.0a20
Fixed /escape to escape semicolons correctly.
Changed input buffer handling for up and down arrow keys when working with
  wrapped lines.  Now instead of going to the next or previous line, it goes
  to the char directly above or below the current insert position.  More like
  TinyFugue.



TrebTk 1.0a19
Changed internals for hilite matching, to make hilighting and script evaluation
  occur together.  This will allow for /substitute.
Added cut/copy/paste right-click popups for all text entry controls.
Added '/substitute STRING' that will replace the string currently being matched
  by hilites.  This should only be run from a triggered /hilite script.  This
  is used to replace the line currently being matched with the new STRING, to
  test against the remaining hilite/triggers.



TrekTk 1.0a18
Fixed worldbutton light so it turns yellow on connecting when re-using a
  display. (Can be checked by using the reconnect item in the worldbutton
  context menu)



TrebTk 1.0a17
Added /log command to turn logging to file on and off.
Added Start/Stop Logging menu item in the File menu.
Added Disabling of File and Edit menu entries when commands aren't valid.
